This is a bot for Marvel Future Fight (MFF)

**NOTE: This bot is still in early stages of development. So expect lots of bugs / issues. When you find one let me know.**

## Setup

1. Install  [NoxPlayer](https://www.bignox.com/)

2. Run NoxPlayer.

3. Go to NoxPlayer system settings.

4. Set resolution to 1920x1080 if possible. Other resolutions might work but are untested.

## Troubleshooting

- The bot expects the NoxPlayer window to be called "NoxPlayer".
  - If this is not the case on your system you can change the expected window name "WindowName" in the settings file. ("settings/config.json")
